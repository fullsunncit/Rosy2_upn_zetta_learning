                <h4><b>Apple MacBook Air (M2)</b></h4>
                <p>The latest MacBook Air, powered by Apple&apos;s M2 processor, is the best laptop for most people.
                    The base model, which includes 8GB of memory, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU, and an 8-core
                    GPU, starts at $1,199. A model with 512GB of storage, which is what we recommend for most 
                    people and will let you keep using the laptop for longer, costs $1,399.</p>

                <h4><b>MacBook Pro (14-inch and 16-inch)</b></h4>
                <p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the most powerful laptop Apple has ever made. If you&apos;re willing to pay the price 
                    (and it&apos;s a steep price), you&apos;ll almost certainly be satisfied with what this machine can do.
                    In our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, 
                    the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we&apos;ve ever used — the only other machines that have come 
                    close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. </p>

                <h4><b>MacBook Air (M1)</b></h4>
                <p>If you&apos;re interested in a lightweight MacBook but the Air is out of your price range, 
                    you&apos;re probably better suited to 2020&apos;s M1 MacBook Air, which Apple is continuing to 
                    sell. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999.
                    The older Air has a 13.3-inch 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint 
                    sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard.

                <h4><b>HP Spectre x360 14</b></h4>
                <p>It&apos;s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It&apos;s a drop-dead gorgeous 
                    machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. 
                    But the Spectre x360 14 isn&apos;t just pretty to look at: it&apos;s also a pleasure to use as a daily work 
                    driver. Intel&apos;s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance
                    with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out 
                    of the device — one of the best results we&apos;ve ever seen. </p>

                <h4><b>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</b></h4>
                <p>The expansive 6.8in LTPO AMOLED display delivers both high WQHD+ resolution and an 
                    adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, while long-term software support that surpasses even 
                    Google&apos;s Pixels rounds out an impressive list of pros. If you can handle its huge size, 
                    it&apos;s a real winner, with five years of software support the best in Android land.</p>

                <h4><b>iPhone 14 Pro</b></h4>
                <p>The regular iPhone 14 is a very minor update over the iPhone 13, so it&apos;s a pleasant surprise 
                    that the iPhone 14 Pro is such a leap over its predecessor. Some of the change is only skin 
                    deep, but when such a visual overhaul as the Dynamic Island makes its debut, it&apos;s hard not to
                    notice.</p>

                <h4><b>Google Pixel 7 Pro</b></h4>
                <p>The Pixel 7 Pro sees Google iterate on the big reinvention of 6 Pro by improving battery 
                    life, display, and the cameras. The 7 Pro is the best Pixel yet and a real &apos;kitchen 
                    sink&apos; device &#45; it&apos;s big and heavy and the design might not be for you, but it 
                    delivers with an amazing Android experience.</p>

                <h4><b>Oppo Find X5 Pro</b></h4>
                <p>The Oppo Find X5 Pro is a phenomenal phone by any measure. The 6.7in 10-bit 120Hz QHD+ panel is one 
                    of the best displays in any phone right now and Oppo backs it up with 80W wired and 50W wireless 
                    charging, a 5000mAh battery, and a top-tier camera that boasts 50Mp sensors on both the main and 
                    ultrawide lenses.</p>

                <h4><b>Google Pixel 6a</b></h4>
                <p>For the asking price you get the Google Tensor chip, the same as the 6 and 6 Pro, 
                    resulting in flagship level performance. Older A-series Pixels were sluggish &#45; not 
                    this one. You only get a 60Hz refresh rate screen, slow 18W charging, and a plastic 
                    back that we found scratches quite easily. There&apos;s also only a 12.2Mp main camera, 
                    the same as on the Pixel 5, rather than the Pixel 6&apos;s 50Mp shooter.</p>
